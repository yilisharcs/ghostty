# GitHub handles of users approved to submit PRs.
#
# See CONTRIBUTING.md for details. The basic idea is that AI in particular
# has made it too easy to create plausible-looking but low-quality 
# contributions. This process lets us move to a network of trust model.
#
# One handle per line (without @). Sorted alphabetically.
#
# Maintainers can add new contributors by commenting "lgtm" on an
# issue by the author.
